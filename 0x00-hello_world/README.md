## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style

### [0. Preprocessor](./0-preprocessor)
* Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.


### [1. Compiler](./1-compiler)
* Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.


### [2. Assembler](./2-assembler)
* Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.


### [3. Name](./3-name)
* Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.


### [4. Hello, puts](./4-puts.c)
* Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.


### [5. Hello, printf](./5-printf.c)
* Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.


### [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](./6-size.c)
* Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.


### [7. What happens when you type gcc main.c](./100-intel)
* Write a blog post that explains all the steps of compilation. Use command lines and examples to illustrate.


### [8. Intel](./101-quote.c)
* Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
